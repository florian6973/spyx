Quickstart
==========

As with other libraries built on top of JAX, you need to install jax with GPU if you want to get the full benefit of this library. Directions for installing JAX with GPU support can be found at the following: https://github.com/google/jax#installation

Check out the examples folder on the GitHub for now! There you'll find worked examples of training SNNs completely on GPU.
