Introduction
============

Spyx is a lightweight JAX-based spiking neural network library that is highly extensible and enables rapid experimentation on GPUs and TPUs. 

The mindset for creating and using Spyx is to train networks completely on accelerator and then export them to neuromorphic hardware through the use of Neuromorphic Intermediate Representation.
